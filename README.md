Childhood-Asthma-Prediction

Overview: The Childhood Asthma Prediction project is a data science-based system designed to predict the likelihood of asthma presence in children based on symptoms provided by the user. This initiative aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, thereby improving the management of childhood asthma.

Potential Impact: The Childhood Asthma Prediction project has the potential to revolutionize the way childhood asthma is diagnosed and managed. Early detection allows for proactive measures and personalized treatment plans, ultimately enhancing the overall well-being of children affected by asthma.

Future Developments: Future developments may involve continuous model refinement through additional data collection and updates. Integration with electronic health records (EHRs) and collaboration with healthcare professionals could further enhance the project's impact on pediatric asthma care.
